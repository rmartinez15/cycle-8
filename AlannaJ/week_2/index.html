		<h1>Llama's Site</h1>
		<h2>This is <em>not</em> a site about llamas.</h2>
		<p>Although llama's are a fluffy and adorable creature, this is not a website for them. <br> Here's a handy little image to help you understand what a llama is:</p>

		<div style="background-color:pink">
			<h2>Other things this site is not about</h2>
			<p>Here's a neat list I've compiled of things this site is not about:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Llama's</li>
				<li>Alpaca's</li>
				<li>Peruvian animals</li>
				<li>Pinata's</li>
				<li>Duck's</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2>What this site is about:</h2>
		<p>I'm sure you want to know what the <strong>purpose</strong> of this site actually is, so here's some questions to help us understand what it is that <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold"> you the user </span> wants to know.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What is this site?</li>
			<li>Why did you create this site?</li>
			<li>What can I do on his site?</li>
		</ol>

		<p> These are all good questions. I hope <a href="http://www.google.com">this cool site</a> can answer those for you!</p>
